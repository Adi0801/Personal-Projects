## Customer Churn Prediction Project

Customer churn, or attrition, refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. This phenomenon can significantly impact a company's revenue, making it crucial for businesses to understand why customers leave and take proactive steps to reduce churn rates. One effective approach is to identify at-risk customer segments and implement targeted retention strategies. Moreover, leveraging data and machine learning techniques enables companies to predict potential churners and intervene proactively to retain them.

### Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build a basic model for predicting customer churn using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). We will utilize various classification algorithms with Python, leveraging tools such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualizations.
