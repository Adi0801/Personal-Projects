Deploying an Object Detection API on AWS involves leveraging several key services:

AWS Lambda: This service serves as the backend for the Object Detection API, handling the processing of requests and responses. By utilizing Lambda, the application benefits from serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

AWS Rekognition: Employing Rekognition, an AI-powered image analysis service, enables the API to accurately detect objects within images. This service provides robust object detection capabilities, helping the API deliver accurate results to users.

API Gateway: API Gateway is utilized to create and manage the public-facing API endpoints. It acts as the entry point for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate Lambda function for processing. API Gateway also facilitates authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, ensuring secure and efficient API access for users.

By integrating these AWS services, the Object Detection API achieves seamless deployment, efficient object detection capabilities, and a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
